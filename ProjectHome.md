## Welcome ##

**GBParsy** is a library of functions that parses the GenBank flatfile, which is a representative and popular sequence format. The library is optimized for speed and efficient use of memory so it can rapidly parse large sequence such as _Arabidopsis_ chromosome for genomic analysis. **GBParsyPy** is additional version of GBParsy for the Python. GBParsyPy adopted GBParsy as a core parser so GBParsyPy inherited all of its features from GBParsy.

## Current Status ##
Version 0.5.4 of GBParsy and GBParsyPy is stable and is recommended for all users.

## Changes ##
**Feb. 20th, 2007** The project name is changed from **GBFP** to **GBParsy**. However, we would not change the program name in order to prevent confusion. Hence, please, visit [GBFP homepage](http://code.google.com/p/gbfp/).
